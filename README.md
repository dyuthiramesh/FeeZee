## PRIMARY RESEARCH
### Interviewees: Finance/Accounts Department, RV University
#### Key Findings:
1. **Need for Integrated Financial Platform:**
   - The interview revealed a pressing need for an integrated platform that consolidates various types of fees, including tuition, development, exam, and co-curricular fees, into one accessible system.
   - Currently, the process for managing these fees is fragmented, leading to inefficiencies and potential errors in record-keeping.
2. **Reminder System:**
   - Participants expressed interest in a reminder system that automatically notifies students and parents via email about upcoming fee deadlines.
   - This feature would enhance communication and help prevent instances of missed payments.
3. **Automated Payment Processing:**
   - There is a strong demand for an automated payment system capable of handling various payment methods, including online forms, demand drafts (DD), and electronic fund transfers (NEFT/RTGS).
   - Such a system would streamline the fee collection process, reduce manual workload, and improve accuracy in financial transactions.
4. **Paper Viewing Integration:**
   - The Examination Department highlighted the potential to integrate paper viewing processes into the platform.
   - Students could pay paper viewing charges through the system and access their exam papers for verification purposes, offering greater convenience and transparency.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
Educational institutions struggle with manual fee management, causing delays, errors, and communication issues. A centralized fee management system is needed to improve efficiency, transparency, and communication.
